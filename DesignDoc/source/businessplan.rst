Business Plan
=============

Business Model
--------------
NASA gives out cash prizes for winning awards and placing in the top three at the RMC.
So, the general business model for Moonrockers to make money is to win.
Coincidentally, that's our goal for this project anyway.

Market and Competition
----------------------
A market is not really applicable to the Moonrockers project because we aren't
selling our product to anyone. We are developing the robot for the sole use of
the Moonrockers team on campus. Even as contractors we aren't selling our work
or time. We do have competition though, and that's the most relevant section of
this business chapter.

Our competition consists of about fifty teams rom around the United States, most
with more money and resources than us. All of these teams are competing to have
the best robot in the competition and therefore win the prize money that comes
with first place. Although there are several deliverables for the competition
such as the design document and outreach document the team submits, the mining
section of the competition depends only on how well the robot performs with a
few points coming from the design such as dust resistance and overall weight.
The majority of points comes from how much material the robot was able to mine
within the allotted time and for the different levels of autonomy. Having been
to the competition before the team has a general idea on how the robot is going
to perform versus the other teams. The current iteration of the robot excelled
in mining and may have won that section last year if not for a mechanical
failure. As far as autonomy goes, Alabama is the only other team to get a fully
autonomous run according to the official 2018 nasa results. If our robot is able
to mine for both runs with fully functional autonomy we believe we will have the
superior robot. 

Like most businesses, we know what the competition is and where they are at. We
observe other teams as the compete and what designs work and dont work. From an
mechanical standpoint, many of the robots had smaller wheels and instantly
became stuck or had excavation buckets that were to small to effectively move
material. Alabama is the main competition in the autonomy section. Although we
do not know the specifics of how their system operates, we know they were using
an expensive lidar system we believe to be for navigational purposes. We elected
to take out own approach as we did not think lidar would be the best solution
nor could we afford a lidar of that quality. 

As we observe the competing teams runs, the other teams will also be observing
us. If our AR tag/camera approach proves to be effective for navigation, other
teams may use our idea. We can not prevent this but instead just make sure our
system performs well consistently. We have the advantage of having a head start
using the methods we developed even if other teams using similar methods which
will hopefully allow us to stay ahead of them. 

Regulatory environment
----------------------
The NASA RMC rule set specifies several regulations that the robot must adhere
to. For safety, they call for a physical kill switch which must be red and
easily accessible. Failure to have a kill switch will result in disqualification
from the competition. There are regulations of the robots mass and dimensions as
well as 43 rules for the competition specified in NASA's entry form. Since our
robot is already at max allowable size, this limits where we can put sensors. We
also have to abide by the rules of how the robot can navigate. Since we can not
use walls, we went the direction of using cameras and AR tags. Violation of any
of the rules outlined will result in disqualification from the competition. 

Intellectual Property and Freedom to Operate
--------------------------------------------
Intellectual Property is detailed the the Senior Design Contract.


Management Team and Advisors
----------------------------
The Moonrockers Team operates as a whole unit but the team President,
currently Carter Barkley organizes events and material purchases.
Dr. Jeff McGough operates as the consultant for the CSC team. He provides
guidance and ideas as we progress.
Dr. Jason Ash is the advisor to the team. He is in ultimate control of
ordering parts using the Moonrocker funds and oversees overall team
operations and overall progress


Sources and Uses of Capital
---------------------------
The South Dakota Mines SOAP Committee is the largest source of money for the
Moonrockers team. They provide the team $5000 overall for materials but extra
funds are used for travel expenses. All other money comes from fund raising and
donations. The amount of donations varies with each year. This money helps
increase the budget for more parts as needed. The software team has used $250 of
the $5,000 Moonrockers has on hardware. Our only purchases were the four cameras
and new brain box enclosure. All materials used by the CSC team, as well as
everyone else, is seen as an investment by the team as most parts and equipment
can be reused the next year. For this year in particular the team is building a
second robot which will use a large portion of the teams funds but the CSC
equipment such as the cameras and computers will be swapped between robots as
needed since the team can not afford to by all the parts required for a second
robot. This is being done to fix some of the mechanical issues of the current
robot while still providing us with a working robot to test on. 

Dr. Ash is in control of team funds and orders all parts needed as requested by
the team. Individual team members can not directly access any funds. The
Moonrockers team is a camp team so no students earn a paycheck. All of the funds
go to materials and transportation for the team as a whole.



Exit Plan
---------
Preparing for the mining competition is a year long process for the team. The
team undergoes changes as members come and go. One of this year's CSC team
members will be around to facilitate technical handoff, but the most important
way to ensure the team's future success is documentation of the software. This
design document, the software and hardware documentation, the git repositories,
and the remaining member will help pass on crucial information. 

The future team is expected to build of off and improve upon what we have
written. For this to happen, the future developers will need ample information
on the systems used. The individual code will contain comments as normal to
specify what the file is doing as well as inline comments throughout each file.
There will also be a detail document that gives an overall description of our
contribution. This will outline the changes we made as a whole such as the
addition of the pseudo controller and the change made to the manual driving
system. This will help the next team with the understanding of the code. However
we will only be documenting the code we wrote or modified. We will not go
through the entire system and add comments to every file. The code we
wrote/modified is the majority of the code directly involving manual control and
all of the autonomy code. With the documentation and the one remaining team
member, the new CSC team should have no problem taking over the codebase.
