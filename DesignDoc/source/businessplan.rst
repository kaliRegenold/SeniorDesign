Business Plan
=============

Business Model
--------------
NASA gives out cash prizes for winning awards and placing in the top three at the RMC.
So, the general business model for Moonrockers to make money is to win.
Coincidentally, that's our goal for this project anyway.

Market and Competition
----------------------
A market is not really applicable to the Moonrockers project---we aren't selling our product to anyone.
Even as contractors we aren't selling our work or time.
We do have competition though, and that's the most relevant section of this business chapter.

Our competition consists of several teams around the United States, some with more money and resources than us.
Luckily, we don't have to convince the judges that we're better.
We just have to out perform.

Regulatory environment
----------------------
The NASA RMC rule set specifies several regulations that the robot must adhere to.
They call for a physical kill switch, but the Moonrockers team wanted a software enable kill switch as well.
Either of the on-board computers can send a kill signal to the robot to stop the motors.
Other regulations are simply the rules that define the competition and are detailed elsewhere.


Intellectual Property and Freedom to Operate
--------------------------------------------
Intellectual Property is detailed the the Senior Design Contract.


Management Team and Advisors
----------------------------
    - The Moonrockers Team
    - Dr. Jeff McGough
    - Dr. Jason Ash


Sources and Uses of Capital
---------------------------
The SD Mines SOAP Committee is the largest source of money for the Moonrockers team.
All other money comes from fund raising and donations.
The software team has used $250 of the $5,000 Moonrockers has on hardware.


Exit Plan
---------
Next year's software team will need to know how the systems work and what they should build off of.
One of this year's team members will be around to facilitate technical handoff, but the most important way to ensure the team's future success is documentation of the software.
This design document, the software and hardware documentation, the git repositories, and the remaining member will help pass on crucial information.
