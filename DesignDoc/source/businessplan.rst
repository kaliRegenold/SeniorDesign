Business Plan
=============

Business Model
--------------
NASA gives out cash prizes for winning awards and placing in the top three at the RMC.
So, the general business model for Moonrockers to make money is to win.
Coincidentally, that's our goal for this project anyway.

Market and Competition
----------------------
A market is not really applicable to the Moonrockers project because we aren't
selling our product to anyone. We are developing the robot for the sole use of
the Moonrockers team on campus. Even as contractors we aren't selling our work
or time. We do have competition though, and that's the most relevant section of
this business chapter.

Our competition consists of about fifty teams rom around the United States, most
with more money and resources than us. All of these teams are competing to have
the best robot in the competition and therefore win the prize money that comes
with first place. Although there are several deliverables for the competition
such as the design document and outreach document the team submits, the mining
section of the competition depends only on how well the robot performs with a
few points coming from the design such as dust resistance and overall weight.
The majority of points comes from how much material the robot was able to mine
within the allotted time and for the different levels of autonomy. Having been
to the competition before the team has a general idea on how the robot is going
to perform versus the other teams. The current iteration of the robot excelled
in mining and may have won that section last year if not for a mechanical
failure. As far as autonomy goes, Alabama is the only other team to get a fully
autonomous run according to the official 2018 nasa results. If our robot is able
to mine for both runs with fully functional autonomy we believe we will have the
superior robot.

Like most businesses, we know what the competition is and where they are at. We
observe other teams as the compete and what designs work and dont work. From an
mechanical standpoint, many of the robots had smaller wheels and instantly
became stuck or had excavation buckets that were to small to effectively move
material. Alabama is the main competition in the autonomy section. Although we
do not know the specifics of how their system operates, we know they were using
an expensive lidar system we believe to be for navigational purposes. We elected
to take out own approach as we did not think lidar would be the best solution
nor could we afford a lidar of that quality. 

As we observe the competing teams runs, the other teams will also be observing
us. If our AR tag/camera approach proves to be effective for navigation, other
teams may use our idea. We can not prevent this but instead just make sure our
system performs well consistently. We have the advantage of having a head start
using the methods we developed even if other teams using similar methods which
will hopefully allow us to stay ahead of them. 

Compared to the rest of the competition, we believe our robot is designed to out perform them. The wheels are large enough to drive in
the soft dirt 

Regulatory environment
----------------------
The NASA RMC rule set specifies several regulations that the robot must adhere to.
They call for a physical kill switch, but the Moonrockers team wanted a software enable kill switch as well.
Either of the on-board computers can send a kill signal to the robot to stop the motors.
Other regulations are simply the rules that define the competition and are detailed elsewhere.


Intellectual Property and Freedom to Operate
--------------------------------------------
Intellectual Property is detailed the the Senior Design Contract.


Management Team and Advisors
----------------------------
    - The Moonrockers Team
    - Dr. Jeff McGough
    - Dr. Jason Ash


Sources and Uses of Capital
---------------------------
The SD Mines SOAP Committee is the largest source of money for the Moonrockers team.
All other money comes from fund raising and donations.
The software team has used $250 of the $5,000 Moonrockers has on hardware.


Exit Plan
---------
Next year's software team will need to know how the systems work and what they should build off of.
One of this year's team members will be around to facilitate technical handoff, but the most important way to ensure the team's future success is documentation of the software.
This design document, the software and hardware documentation, the git repositories, and the remaining member will help pass on crucial information.
