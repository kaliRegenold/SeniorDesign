Robot Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The robot consists of a custom articulating aluminum frame with 4 wheels. The
frame of the robot should fit within a 1.5m length x 0.75m width x 0.75m height
cube. Each wheel is driven by its own motor/drive system. Fitted on top of the
frame is a fully adjustable regolith extractor. The regolith extractor dumps
regolith into a deposition system which consists of a belt driven elevator 
system that forms a V shape to act as a regolith hopper.

The robot consists of several electronics systems.  The majority of the systems
are located in the main removable electrical box located at the bottom rear of
the robot. The main electrical box houses batteries, power management systems,
and motor control circuitry. The secondary electronics box is located on the
left side of the robot. The secondary electronics box is smaller and houses the
embedded systems and computers responsible for controlling the robot. Both 
boxes are weather sealed to prevent dust from interfearing with the circuits.
