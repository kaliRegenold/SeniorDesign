Competition Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The NASA Robotic Mining Competition involves university teams across the United States building a robot capable of mining icy-regolith either remotely, semi autonomously or fully autonomously. The competition takes place indoors in pre-build practice pits. The pits are covered in dirt on top of rock and have a set mining site and a hopper to deposite rock that has been mined. The robot is placed in a random orientation in front of the hopper and must navigate across the pit to the mining location. The robot must then mine past the top layer of dirt to the the regolith and fill the hopper in the robot with the regolith. Once full it must navigate back to the hopper and deposit the mined regolith. 

These tasks can be performed with a remote control however points are deducted for bandwith usage when communicating with the robot on the field. Points are also deducted for every kilogram the robot weighs. Points are gained from successfully depositing regolith into the hopper and more points are awarded for more regolith collected. A large amount of points are also awarded for a robot that accomplishes these tasks autonomously. 

Robot Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The robot consists of a custom articulating aluminum frame with 4 wheels. The
frame of the robot should fit within a 1.5m length x 0.75m width x 0.75m height
cube. Each wheel is driven by its own motor/drive system. Fitted on top of the
frame is a fully adjustable regolith extractor. The regolith extractor dumps
regolith into a deposition system which consists of a belt driven elevator 
system that forms a V shape to act as a regolith hopper.

The robot consists of several electronics systems.  The majority of the systems
are located in the main removable electrical box located at the bottom rear of
the robot. The main electrical box houses batteries, power management systems,
and motor control circuitry. The secondary electronics box is located on the
left side of the robot. The secondary electronics box is smaller and houses the
embedded systems and computers responsible for controlling the robot. Both 
boxes are weather sealed to prevent dust from interfearing with the circuits.
