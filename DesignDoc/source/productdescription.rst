Competition Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The NASA Robotic Mining Competition involves university teams across the United States building a robot capable of mining icy-regolith either remotely, semi autonomously or fully autonomously. The competition takes place indoors in pre-build practice pits. The pits are covered in dirt on top of rock and have a set mining site and a hopper to deposite rock that has been mined. The robot is placed in a random orientation in front of the hopper and must navigate across the pit to the mining location. The robot must then mine past the top layer of dirt to the the regolith and fill the hopper in the robot with the regolith. Once full it must navigate back to the hopper and deposit the mined regolith. 

These tasks can be performed with a remote control however points are deducted for bandwith usage when communicating with the robot on the field. Points are also deducted for every kilogram the robot weighs. Points are gained from successfully depositing regolith into the hopper and more points are awarded for more regolith collected. A large amount of points are also awarded for a robot that accomplishes these tasks autonomously.
