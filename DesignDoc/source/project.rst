Project Management
==================

Team Member’s Roles
-------------------

- Kyle lorenz - Software Developer
- Kali Reginold	- Software Developer
- Johnathan Westlund - Software Developer

Project Management Approach
---------------------------

The project will be developed in an agile manner. Sprint lengths with
be one week. Entire team meetings will take place every Monday with additional
autonomy specific meetings will take place on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Trello will be used to manage user stories and the product backlog. The Trello page is accessible by 
anyone on the moonrockers team, but mainly used by the autonomy team. Sprint 
tasks will also be written on the Trello board as well as trouble tickets. 
Git will only be used for code management.

Stakeholder Information
------------------------

The Moonrockers team will be the primary stakeholder along with faculty advisors
for the team.

Customer or End User (Product Owner)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The final user will be the Moonrockers team. The team as a whole will take responsibility
for managing the product backlog. Because team members enter and graduate, the backlog will
not be managed by a single person. If there are any questions about the backlog the team
members should contact the most recent graduated seniors. 

Management or Instructor (Scrum Master)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Carter Barkley, the current Moonrockers president will be the Scrum master. Although he will
not directly be involved in the autonomy team, he will lead sprint meetings and monitor
overall progress of the autonomy team as well as aid on collaberation of the autonomy team
with the rest of the Moonrockers team.

Developers – Testers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Kali Reginold is the unofficial project manager. Every member will participate in
development and testing of code. 

Budget
------

The Moonrockers team has a budget of $5000 to cover all expenses for the team. The autonomy
team will be able to use funds as needed with permission from the rest of the team. The
robot and current existing hardware are provided by the team. Any sensors or computers
added by the autonomy team will be provided by the Moonrockers team. Depending on the
equipment used it may be lent to the team for this year only.

Intellectual Property and Licensing
-----------------------------------

Any code and algorithms used will belong to the Moonrockers team for future team use. 
However the autonomy team reserves the right to redistibute written code as our own.

Sprint Overview
---------------

If the system will be implemented in phases, describe those
phases/sub-phases (design, implementation, testing, delivery) and the
various milestones in this section. This section should also contain a
correlation between the phases of development and the associated
versioning of the system, i.e. major version, minor version, revision.

All of the Agile decisions are listed here. For example, how do you
order your backlog? Did you use planning poker?

Terminology and Acronyms
------------------------

Provide a list of terms used in the document that warrant definition.
Consider industry or domain specific terms and acronyms as well as
system specific.

Sprint Schedule
---------------

The sprint schedule. Can be tables or graphs. This can be a list of
dates with the visual representation given below.

Timeline
--------

Gantt chart or other type of visual representation of the project
timeline.

Development Environment
-----------------------

The basic purpose for this section is to give a developer all of the
necessary information to setup their development environment to run,
test, and/or develop.

Development IDE and Tools
-------------------------

Describe which IDE and provide links to installs and/or reference
material.

Source Control
--------------

Which source control system is/was used? How was it setup? How does a
developer connect to it?

Dependencies
------------

Describe all dependencies associated with developing the system.

Build Environment
