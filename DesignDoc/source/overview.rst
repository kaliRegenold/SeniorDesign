Overview, Description, and Deliverables
======================================

This section outlines the project at a high level. The client and the 
project are described below.
The project involves creating a computer system and software to make an 
existing robot fully autonomous for the Moonrockers team. The Moonrockers team
is described in the client section and the competition is discussed in the
business section. The expectations of what will be created for the Moonrockers
team is listed in the deliverable section.

Client
------

The Moonrockers are a multidisciplinary team that participates in the NASA 
Robotic Mining Competition each year at the Kennedy Space Center.  Activities 
are focused on vehicle development, student professional development, teaming,
and K-12 outreach.

NASA's Robotics Mining competition is designed to promote the development of 
interest in space activities and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and 
Mathematics) fields. For more information about the Competition, 
see https://www.nasa.gov/offices/education/centers/kennedy/technology/nasarmc.html.

Project
-------

The main goal of the project is to implement full, uninterrupted autonomy on
the Moonrockers' robot for the NASA Robotic Mining Competition (RMC).  The 
Moonrockers team has continued to show excellence in previous years at the 
competition. The next goal is for the robot to operate under complete autonomy. The current state of
the project already handles much of the mechanical controls, which leaves 
localization, path planning, and collection and deposition to be developed.

Mission Statement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our goal is to help Moonrockers achieve a fully capable robot which 
surpasses previous attempts.

Elevator Pitch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Space is full of scientific potential and untapped resources. However, due to
the current limitation of technology we must rely on machines to study and
potentially gather resources from places other than earth.
Due to the vastness of space, direct human control is not possible and machines
must be able to preform tasks on their own.  Our goal at Moonrockers is to 
research and develop a fully autonomous mining machine that can compete 
in the NASA RMC, a competition that simulates 
Martian conditions.  In years past, Moonrockers have perfected the mechanics of 
such a machine, and are now focusing on autonomous control.

Purpose of the System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Implementing autonomy on the robot is useful for simulating a lack of contact 
with a robot on Mars. The Mars environment provides a number of challenges
that the robot needs to overcome independent of human control. An autonomous
system will mitigate safety concerns as the robot can make decisions for itself.

Business/Market Need
--------------------

NASA's Robotics Mining Competition calls for heavy emphasis on autonomy, awarding 500 points for a fully autonomous system.
Moonrockers' goal is to win the competition, so a large focus has been placed on autonomy for the robot.
A successful system could win the team upwards of $4,000.

Product Description:
    A fully autonomous system for the Moonrockers' robot that implements localization, obstacle collision avoidance, and path planning.

Key Business Goals:
    Win the NASA RMC with a fully autonomous system to further research in the Mars robotics field.
