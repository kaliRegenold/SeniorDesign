Client
------

The Moonrockers are a multidisciplinary team that participates in the NASA Robotic Mining Competition each year at the Kennedy Space Center.  Activities are focused on vehicle development, student professional development, teaming, and K-12 outreach.

NASA's Robotics Mining competition is designed to promote the development of interest in space activities and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields. For more information about the competition, see: https://www.nasa.gov/offices/education/centers/kennedy/technology/nasarmc.html

Project
-------

The main goal of the project is to implement full, uninterrupted autonomy on the Moonrocker's robot for the NASA 
Robotic mining competition (RMC).  The Moonrockers team has continued to show excelence in previous years at the
competition. However, in order to take the excelence to the next level, it is required for the Robot to operate
under complete autonomy. The current state of the project already handles much of the mechanical controls, which 
leaves localization, obstacle collision avoidance, and path planning to be developed.

Mission Statement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our goal is to help Moonrockers achieve a fully capable robot which surpasses previous attempts.

Elevator Pitch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Space is full of scientific potential and untapped resources. However, due to the current limitation of technology we must rely on machines to study and potentially gather resources from places other than earth.
Due to the vastness of space direct human control is not possible and machines must be able to preform tasks on their own.  Our goal at Moonrockers is to research and develop a fully autonomous mining machine that can compete against the best autonomous mining machines in a competition simulating martian contitions.  In years past Moonrockers have perfected the mechanics of such a machine, but have put little effort into the autonomous control. In 2018/2019, we intend to change that.

Purpose of the System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Implementing autonomy on the robot is useful for simulating a lack of contact with a robot on Mars.
The Mars environment provides a number of challenges that the robot needs to overcome independent of human control.
An autonomous system will mitigate safety concerns as the robot can make decisions for itself.

Business/Market Need
--------------------

NASA's Robotics Mining Competition calls for heavy emphasis on autonomy, awarding 500 points for a fully autonomous system.
Moonrocker's goal is to win the NASA competition, so a large focus has been placed on autonomy for their robot.
A successful system could win the team upwards of $4,000.
